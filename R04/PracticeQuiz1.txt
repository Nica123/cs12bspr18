Part I.
Download the pq1 folder from R04 in github.
Your job is to write the CarPool class according to the following specification:

The CarPool class represent a carpooling vehicle.
It has a constructor that allows you to create a Carpool by specifying
* The name of the owner of the car, e.g. "Tim Hickey"
* The pick up place, e.g. "Coolidge Corner"
* The pick up time  e.g. "8 am"
* The departure time, e.g. "5 pm"
* The number of possible carpoolers e.g. 4
These values should be stored in private instance variables.
You should write the constructor to create a carpool object from this information,
e.g.
CarPool car = new CarPool("Tim Hickey","Coolidge Corner","8 am","5 pm", 4);

You should write the following instance methods:

toString() method which will produce the following String
representation for the object:
car.toString() -->
carpool(Tim Hickey leaves Coolidge Corner at 8 am returns 5 pm has 4 available seats)

addRider() --> which decreases the number of available seats by 1, 

removeRider() --> which increases the number of available seats by 1, 

getAvailableSeats() --> which returns the number of available getAvailableSeats

You can assume the user will not try to add too many riders or remove a rider from an empty car.


****************************************************************

Part II. If you can complete Part I, then copy your solution to a new folder pq1a
and modify it so that it adds and removes riders by name and returns the list of current riders.
Remove the old addRider and removeRider methods and replace them with 
addRider(name)
removeRider(name)
getCurrentRiders() --> returns array of names of current riders
getAvailableSeats() --> returns number of available seats

Also add code to throw an Exception if they try to add a rider to a full car or remove a rider from an empty car.

Also modify the TestCarPool code so that it tests these features and throws an exception if they incorrect add or remove riders.
